# Documentation Standards in Markdown

While Markdown offers a lot of flexibility, it helps to have an established standard on how documents are formatted (especially in group projects such as this!)

This document outlines some standards we should try to follow, in order to have the best experience writing the project documentation.

## Markdown File Template

Please refer to [this Markdown template file](./MarkdownTemplate.md) as a starting point.

## Filenames

Please use the following filenames when applicable:

- Documents
  - Documents should be stored under "Sections" folder.
  - Documents should be named "[Section Name, no spaces].md"

- Images
  - All images should be stored under "Images" folder.
  - All non-charts and graphs images should be named "Img-\[Shortname of Picture, no spaces\].\[png, gif, or jpg\]
  - Charts and Graphs should be named "\[Chart or Graph\]-\[Shortname of Chart/Graph, no spaces\].\[png, gif, or jpg\]

## Things NOT To Do

While there is a lot of freedom with doing projects like this, some things should be considered by including them:

- No passwords! (or other sensitive credentials)
  - Do not store usernames, passwords, OAuth secrets and keys, and other authentication data in a repository. Anyone can see this publicly. It's not secure.

- Don't go past subsubsections (###)
  - Try to keep subsections, at maximum, at level three or less. Level Four (####) or more may look funny on some devices or renderers.
