# Markdown Template

This is an example of a Markdown file! Here, you can write introductory information for the section you're writing on. However, at some point, you may want to make a subsection...

## Here's a subsection

So, we've made as subsection! Here, you can write about the subsection, what it means, and what it does. However, sometimes you may need a subsubsection...

### Here's a subsubsection

So, here's that... we can keep doing this down as many as six times! However, let's try to keep this the minimum.

## Moving on...

You also have the ability to integrate tables, images, [links](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ), and other elements (see [Documentation Getting Started](./Documentation%20Getting%20Started.md) for more information.)

### Tables

Here's a table:
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 | Column 4 |
| :-- | --: | :-: | --- |
| Content A | Content B | Content C | |
| Sometimes | a | blank | cell |
| | can | | exist |

### Images

Here's an embedded image of my cat:
![This is alternative text.](./Images/Cat.png)

(Her name is Java!)

Images should be stored and referenced from the Images folder (under Documentation).

Since some of our images may be charts and graphs, it may help to standardize the naming convention of these files. Check [Documentation Standards](./Documentation%20Standards.md) for more information.

### Code Snippets

You can also add code snippets!

```js title="JavaScript Snippet!"
function myFunction(hello){

}
```

Docusaurus will interpret this more accurately than VSCode's Markdown render (or other renderers you may use.)

## Final Thoughts

Some other things to consider are that there should be a blank line above and below any heading. Also, no line should have a trailing space after the last punctuation point. Finally, the document should end with a blank line.

I hope this template is helpful! Feel free to ask me questions or anything at [trevor.brown593@topper.wku.edu](mailto:trevor.brown593@topper.wku.edu).
